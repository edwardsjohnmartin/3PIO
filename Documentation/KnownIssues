3PIO Known Issues

Move run alert to top.
	Expected difficulty: Very easy

Pairs for sections should get course name as part of name in sproc_read_sections_get_pairs.
	Expected difficulty: Very easy

... I should use try/catches in my database calls (in the models).
	Expected difficulty: Easy

Right now, the project student code is saved on each run. Probably should also be a save button. Should also mark when something has changed so that if users try to leave the page it will pop up and ask if they're sure they want to leave.
	Expected difficulty: Easy

Home page should show class by default for student if there is one class only. Should show list if there are multiple.
	Expected difficulty: Easy

User should not be allowed to access create concept if there are no projects available. It should be similar to the error when trying to create an exercise without any lessons. However, it shouldn't break anything without having that error. The concept just won't be valid and won't be able to be added to the database.
	Expected difficulty: Easy

Feature to test projects. The testing exercises is to make sure that the test code works, but projects do not have any test code. Teacher may still want to make sure starter code works properly.
	Expected difficulty: Easy

Exercise list on left needs to scroll with current exercise
	Expected difficulty: Easy

Currently no pagination. Should use a mix of "get_pairs" and "subset" in the model. Database call should get a subset of pairs.
	Expected difficulty: Easy

Keyboard shortcuts
	Expected difficulty: Easy

SECURITY: The database users need to be used properly.
	Expected difficulty: Medium

SECURITY: Need HTTPS.
	Expected difficulty: Medium

There is currently no delete feature. The stored procedures are there for the simple cases. The lesson case is more difficult because it should also delete associated lessons. It would be fine just to mark the lesson and the associated exercises as deleted, and keep the links in the exercises to lessons table.
	Expected difficulty: Medium

If a student skips a project, it will still appear as the current one that is open by default in the section/read_student view, even if the due date has passed.
	Expected difficulty: Medium

Aliases for dev and live. I started setting it up but realized that the session is shared, which would be a problem. Changing the paths to be "?" instead of "/?" is required in the redirect functions in routes.php and in view/shared/layout.php and possibly views/shared/html_helper.php.

Exercises are in the lesson in the order that they are added. If edited, the exercise gets pushed to the back. Originally, the exercises were added to lessons in bulk through the lesson create/edit, and it was possible to add them in the desired order and easily move them. This is no longer available because the add was moved to the exercise by request so that an exercise could only belong to one lesson (zero not allowed). A hybrid of the two would probably be nice. Note that the exercise's owner is the owner of the lesson that it belongs to.
	Expected difficulty: Difficult

There is no reset password feature. This requires being able to send emails from PHP.
	Expected default: Difficult

Need better validation by default. The model checks types. There are many cases where I send an ID, but I don't check if that ID meets the restraints in the database (corresponding row exists). Something in the controller that the base could call to validate?
	Expected difficulty: Difficult

Better errors in general would be nice. Which property failed. Also, on fail, keep the old properties that were good.
	Expected difficult: Difficult

The model possibly should have had get edit properties/get display properties for better automatic views. Well, some things (for example, owner ID from session) need to be changed manually anyway.
	Expected difficulty: Difficult

The session on /dev is not working on the server! Sessions on the main version work fine.
