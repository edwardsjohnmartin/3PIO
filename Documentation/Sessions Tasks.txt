-----To-Do for Sessions-----

(DONE)1. Add table to keep track of sessions of completing activities(exercises, projects, or questions). 

(in-progress)2. Program session behavior in a js file
	(DONE)A session will start as soon as the user loads an activity.
	(DONE)The session stays alive as long as the user is interacting with the page(mouse click, keypress, run button pressed).
		(DONE)Keep track of how many times each occured. 
	(DONE)If there is no interaction detected in 5 minutes, the session information is saved to the database and a new session begins.
		(DONE)If mouse_clicks, keypresses, and run_button_presses are all 0, the session doesn't need to be saved.
	(in-progress)If the tab is closed, browser is closed normally, browser is force closed, page refreshed, or page navigated away from, the session needs to be saved
		so far it works in chrome when:
		   tab is closed
		   page is navigated away from
		needs further testing in chrome:
		   browser is closed normally
		   browser is force-closed
		   page refreshed
		so far it works in firefox when:
		   tab is closed
                   page is navigated away from
		   browser is closed normally
		   browser is force-closed
		needs further testing in firefox:
		   page refreshed
		even further testing
		   microsoft edge
		   firefox
		even further further testing
		   test everything on a mac

(in-progress)3. Add database functions. 
	(DONE)write_session(user_id, activity_name, activity_id, start_time, end_time, mouse_clicks, keypresses, run_button_presses)

	read_get_sessions_for_student(user_id)
	   returns all sessions for a student

	read_get_sessions_type_exercise()
	   returns all sessions that occurred in an exercise

	read_get_sessions_type_project()
	   returns all sessions that occurred in an project

	read_get_sessions_type_question()
	   returns all sessions that occurred in an question

4. Add a sessions class in the model folder. 
	not sure if this is going to be required or not
	maybe when pulling the sessions out of the database it might be

(DONE)5. Add a sessions controller in controller folder.

6. Add a read_sessions view in the view folder. 
	To be able to click an activity and view the sessions. 
	View all sessions for a student in a list organized by activity then by start_time.
	Click on a specific activity and view all sessions organized by start_time. 

-----Questions for Dr. Edwards-----

Any other metrics that need to be saved?

Is session a bad name?
   What would a better name be?

Should we track which mouse button was clicked?
   left, right, middle

Is 5 minutes ok for session time?

How should the sessions be viewed by the teacher/ta?
   A page for the section?
   A page for each student?
   A page for each individual activity?
   A page for all exercises?
   A page for all questions?
   A page for all projects?

Should we save each exercise, question, and project in the context of where the student took it at? 
   save the lesson_id and concept_id for exercises
   save the exam_id for questions
   save the concept_id for projects

   right now only the activity_id itself is saved so there is no telling where the student was during the sessions
   this could cause a problem is an exercise was in multiple lessons
   or if projects were in multiple concepts
