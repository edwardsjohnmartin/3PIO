Lesson: Lists I
Ex:
<d>This code creates a list of names. The name at index 0 is "Mandy". Change the name that is printed to "Mike" by changing the 0 to a 1.</d>
<s>names = ["Mandy", "Mike", "Michelle", "Mulligan"]
print(names[0])
</s>
<t>test_out("Mike")
</t>

Ex:
<d>Change the printed name to "Michelle". Hint: change the 0 to a 2.</d>
<s>names = ["Mandy", "Mike", "Michelle", "Mulligan"]
print(names[0])
</s>
<t>test_out("Michelle")
</t>

Ex:
<d>The number we put in the brackets is called the "index" into the array. Indices start at 0, strangely enough. Change the printed name to "Mulligan" by changing the index into 'names'.</d>
<s>names = ["Mandy", "Mike", "Michelle", "Mulligan"]
print(names[0])
</s>
<t>test_out("Mulligan")
test_in("names[3]")
</t>
