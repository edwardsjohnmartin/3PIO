Updating the site

I remove the files from the server and replace them.

On server:
sudo rm -r ~/pppio

On mine:
scp -r /media/jac/DATA/Projects/LIVE/pppio oryjacq@3pio.cose.isu.edu:~

On server:
sudo rm -r /var/www/pppio
sudo cp -r ~/pppio /var/www/pppio

Can't scp directly to /var/www because permissions.

Important notes:
There are three files that are different in the live version than the version on Github.

connection.php contains the logins for the main database, which are different from the logins for the dev database.

controllers/user_controller.php has and uses a server side salt for passwords (didn't want real salt on Github + added later).

index.php sets the session name so that the session variables are different between the dev site and live site.
	Live on server is main URL.
	Dev on server is /dev, so I've changed the local version to be on that as well. Session variables will only work here unless you change in index.php, but it shouldn't be changed on the server version. Best to be consistent with the server, I think. (I don't know how to force alias to make it so that /dev is always used in my local environment... but please use /dev.)
