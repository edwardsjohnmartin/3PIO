Updating the site

I remove the files from the server and replace them.

On server:
sudo rm -r ~/pppio

On mine:
scp -r /media/jac/DATA/Projects/LIVE/pppio oryjacq@3pio.cose.isu.edu:~

On server:
sudo rm -r /var/www/pppio
sudo cp -r ~/pppio /var/www/pppio

Can't scp directly to /var/www because permissions.

Important notes:
There are three files that are different in the live version than the version on Github.

connection.php contains the logins for the main database, which are different from the logins for the dev database.

controllers/user_controller.php has and uses a server side salt for passwords (didn't want real salt on Github + added later).

index.php sets the session name so that the session variables are different between the dev site and live site.
	Live on server is main URL.
	Dev on server is /dev.

layout.php - Title and upper left name "3PIO"/"3PIO Dev"
