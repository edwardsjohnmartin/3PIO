Updating the website on the server

On server:
  ~edwajohn/pppio-prep

On local computer:
  Jac:
    scp -r /media/jac/DATA/Projects/LIVE/pppio oryjacq@3pio.cose.isu.edu:~/pppio
  John:
    scp -r ~/projects/3PIO/pppio_dev 3pio.cose.isu.edu:~/pppio

On server:
  ~edwajohn/pppio-finish

Important notes:
There are four files that are different in the live version than the version
on Github. These are stored in /var/www/pppio-stash and are copied into the
version in the scripts.

1. connection.php -- contains the logins for the main database,
     which are different from the logins for the dev database.

2. controllers/user_controller.php -- has and uses a server side salt for
     passwords (didn't want real salt on Github + added later).

3. index.php -- sets the session name so that the session variables are
     different between the dev site and live site.
	Live on server is main URL.
	Dev on server is /dev.

4. layout.php -- Title and upper left name should be changed from
    "3PIO Dev" to "3PIO". This file is not managed automatically. The strings
    should be changed prior to uploading the file to the server.
