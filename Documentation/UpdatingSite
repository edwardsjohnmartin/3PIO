Updating the site

I remove the files from the server and replace them.

On server:
sudo rm -r ~/pppio

Jac:
  scp -r /media/jac/DATA/Projects/LIVE/pppio oryjacq@3pio.cose.isu.edu:~/pppio
John:
  scp -r ~/projects/3PIO/pppio_dev 3pio.cose.isu.edu:~/pppio

On server:
sudo rm -r /var/www/pppio
sudo cp -r ~/pppio /var/www/pppio

Can't scp directly to /var/www because permissions.

Important notes:
There are four files that are different in the live version than the version on Github.

1. connection.php -- connection.php contains the logins for the main database, which are different from the logins for the dev database.

2. user_controller.php -- controllers/user_controller.php has and uses a server side salt for passwords (didn't want real salt on Github + added later).

3. index.php -- index.php sets the session name so that the session variables are different between the dev site and live site.
	Live on server is main URL.
	Dev on server is /dev.

4. layout.php -- Title and upper left name should be changed from "3PIO Dev" to "3PIO"
