(MED)
    (BUG)
        make the review_exam link active only when a student has at least 1 answer on the exam
        
(MED)
    (FEATURE)
         On section grades view per exam, include average, high, low
         Be able to sort columns
        
         In the future include avg time on each question, most missed question, etc...
         
(LOW)
    (FEATURE)
         (DATABASE) On exam review page per student, include % of time on each question
         (DATABASE) time_taken starts at 0, timer starts when they to get to question, when they leave the difference is added to time_taken 
         (VIEW) How long did the student take on the exam (latest date_updated - earliest date_updated)  
	 Save a time when they first opened the exam

(MED)
    (FEATURE/BUG)
        Add a close option that allows you to close the students who get done with the test early
        Currently, if a student leaves the exam early, if the close_time isnt updated for that student they would still be able to access it and could look up answers

(LOW)
    (BUG)
        dont run logout script in sandbox, only exercise, project, and question

(HIGH)
    if a student hasnt done a set of exercises
    the button to get to the project of any concept that comes after will be disabled
    this makes it SEEM like the student cannot access the project and will need to do the previous exercises

    the route to project will still be open to the student thought and if they enter the correct concept_id into the address bar
    they will be able to access the project with no issue
    it will still allow them to save the project

    there is also a bug with partners where if there are 2 students
    student A has completed all the exercises and has access to the current project
    student B has not completed all the exercises and does not have access to the current project
    if stud A logs in and adds stud B as a partner
    the code will still be saved for stud B with no issue

    (FIX)
        (FUNCTION)make a project/exercise/concept/lesson controller function that checks for unfinished exercises
            make sure to check if exercises/lessons exist in that concept and account for it
            should only be based on exercise completion, not project completion 
        when there is 1 person logged in
            put a check on the project controller that finds out if they have access to that project
                if they havent completed the exercises
            display message ('you need to complete exercises from [earliest unfinished concept name] in order to access this project')
        when there is more than 1 person logged in
            put a check on the project controller that finds out if all logged in users have access to the project
            if any user hasnt completed the exercises
                display message ('[user name] needs to complete more exercises for this group to access the project')

(HIGH)
    (BUG)
        as a ta
        when there are no lessons with no exercises in a concept, but that concept still
        has a project, there is no way to access the view code for the project
        this means a ta will have no way of grading the project 
    (FIX)
        create a table header row
            student column exists when there are students in the section the concept belongs to
            a column exists for each lesson in the concept as long as there are exercises in the lesson
            project column exists as long as a project exists for that concept

(LOW)
    (BUG)
        a ta/teacher can access the check project view for a student even if they havent 
        submitted any code for that project by changing the id value in the address bar

	when they access it, the start code for the project isnt displayed although with the 
        proposed fix, this will be a non-issue
        
        this is inconsistent because the 'view code' link will not be available to the ta/teacher
        on the controller=concept&action=read view

    (FIX)
        if a ta/teacher tries to access the project for a student with no progress on that project
        display message('[student name] has not started this project')

(HIGH)
    (VIEW)on pages with left navbar for tiles, code area, output area   (exercise editor for sure)
    (VIEW)making the <div class="textOutput"> height to 100% and <pre id="output"> height to 100% makes it scroll

(HIGH)figure out how an exam knows what section to be created for when doing regulare create
   (CHECK)figure out how an exam knows what section to be created for with the importer
   (FIX)make sure you can set the exam section through the importer

[which solution to implement?]
(LOW)questions heading shown but doesn't display questions
   (SOLUTION)make questions not visible on either
   (SOLUTION)make questions only visible on /shared/read.php
   (VIEW)happens in /exam/update_times.php and /shared/read.php

(MED)exam instructions aren't being filled when created through importer
   (REGEX)fix get_exams function in /importer.php 

(MED)need to show exam instructions to the students in some way
   (VIEW)can only see instructions in /exam/update_times.php and /shared/read.php

[we want to make both grade views the same as it is on the exam]
(MED)check to see how we want to show weights in grade views
   (VIEW)/grades/section_grades.php
   (VIEW)/grades/exam_grades_for_student.php)

(HIGH)need to make sure a student can't access controller functions they shouldnt
   (CONTROLLER)(ROUTES)need to make sure ta's can access what they should
   (CONTROLLER)(ROUTES)need to make sure ta's can't access what they shouldn't

(VERY LOW)sproc_read_section_get(id integer) can return concepts that are deleted
    (CONTROLLER)as a ta, on controller=section action=read id=[section_id] 
    (CONTROLLER)deleted concepts show up
    (VIEW)creates links to controller=concept action=read id=[concept_id] that lead to error page

[which solution to implement?]
(LOW)make exam delete button work
   (DATABASE)sproc_write_exam_delete(exam_id)
   (DATABASE)exam_id is saved in question so we should delete the questions associated with that exam too
   (DATABASE)or we can take out the exam_id column from questions and make a question_to_exam table and remove the links of those questions to the deleted exam

(LOW)annotate point value on left navbar squares
   (VIEW)(MODEL)

(LOW)should we block entry to controller=question action=read_for_student if a partner is logged in? NOT YET
   (CHECK)scenario: student1 logged in, student2 logged in as partner, student2 logs in on another computer, student1 removes student2 from partners. ?does this log out student2 from other computer?

[which solution to implement?]
(MED)add a way to track when the window regained focus while a student is taking an exam
   (DATABASE)rename user_left_page_occurrences to just occurrences
   (DATABASE)change date_of_occurrence column to time_left
   (DATABASE)add column time_returned
   (VIEW)will also need a better way to view these
   (VIEW)do we want to see all the occurred in the sections the logged-in user has access to 
   (VIEW)do we want to view by sections, students, exams, or questions

(MED)ta's need to be able to view occurrences

(LOW)move occurrence files to make more logical sense
   (VIEW)add /occurences/ folder and put views in there
   (VIEW)move /questions/read_occurrences.php to occurrences/ folder and rename to read
   (CONTROLLER)move read_occurrences function in /question_controller.php to /exam_controller.php

(HIGH)need a way to review exams
   (VIEW)need to also show the timestamp of completion

(LOW)add a button to view/question/editor that replaces the current code with the start code
               
(MED)test section_grades view as ta/teacher
   (TEST)no exams in section
   (TEST)no questions in exam
   (TEST)no students in section

(DONE)
    (BUG/JS)when a student is doing a project, when they hit the run button, the code
