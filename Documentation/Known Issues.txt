[which solution to implement?]
(LOW)questions heading shown but doesn't display questions
   (SOLUTION)make questions not visible on either
   (SOLUTION)make questions only visible on /shared/read.php
   (VIEW)happens in /exam/update_times.php and /shared/read.php

(MED)exam instructions aren't being filled when created through importer
   (REGEX)fix get_exams function in /importer.php 

(MED)need to show exam instructions to the students in some way
   (VIEW)can only see instructions in /exam/update_times.php and /shared/read.php

[we want to make both grade views the same as it is on the exam]
(MED)check to see how we want to show weights in grade views
   (VIEW)/grades/section_grades.php
   (VIEW)/grades/exam_grades_for_student.php)

(HIGH)need to make sure a student can't access controller functions they shouldnt
   (CONTROLLER)(ROUTES)need to make sure ta's can access what they should
   (CONTROLLER)(ROUTES)need to make sure ta's can't access what they shouldn't

(VERY LOW)sproc_read_section_get(id integer) can return concepts that are deleted
    (CONTROLLER)as a ta, on controller=section action=read id=[section_id] 
    (CONTROLLER)deleted concepts show up
    (VIEW)creates links to controller=concept action=read id=[concept_id] that lead to error page

[which solution to implement?]
(LOW)make exam delete button work
   (DATABASE)sproc_write_exam_delete(exam_id)
   (DATABASE)exam_id is saved in question so we should delete the questions associated with that exam too
   (DATABASE)or we can take out the exam_id column from questions and make a question_to_exam table and remove the links of those questions to the deleted exam

(LOW)annotate point value on left navbar squares
   (VIEW)(MODEL)

(LOW)should we block entry to controller=question action=read_for_student if a partner is logged in? NOT YET
   (CHECK)scenario: student1 logged in, student2 logged in as partner, student2 logs in on another computer, student1 removes student2 from partners. ?does this log out student2 from other computer?

[which solution to implement?]
(MED)add a way to track when the window regained focus while a student is taking an exam
   (DATABASE)rename user_left_page_occurrences to just occurrences
   (DATABASE)change date_of_occurrence column to time_left
   (DATABASE)add column time_returned
   (VIEW)will also need a better way to view these
   (VIEW)do we want to see all the occurred in the sections the logged-in user has access to 
   (VIEW)do we want to view by sections, students, exams, or questions

(MED)ta's need to be able to view occurrences

(LOW)move occurrence files to make more logical sense
   (VIEW)add /occurences/ folder and put views in there
   (VIEW)move /questions/read_occurrences.php to occurrences/ folder and rename to read
   (CONTROLLER)move read_occurrences function in /question_controller.php to /exam_controller.php

(HIGH)need a way to review exams
   (VIEW)need to also show the timestamp of completion

(LOW)add a button to view/question/editor that replaces the current code with the start code
               
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(DONE)ALWAYS POPULATE ERROR MESSAGE

(DONE)How do I handle bringing up a question where there is starter code?
    (DONE)YES - If an answer exists don't show starter code?
    (DONE)NO - Have a reset button that puts the starter code back?
    (DONE)YES - Show the starter code in the instructions?

(DONE)change the permission type of controller=grades action=get_section_grades so TA can see grades   
   (DONE)will need to do error handling to make sure only a TA student will be able to access this

(DONE)on controller=question action=read_for_student or run button being pressed
   (DONE)check to make sure current_time is still within start_time and close_time

(DONE)not updating tiles when there is a bug in the code
   (DONE)is updating tiles when finished successfully
   (DONE)is updating when no bugs but not correct tested again test_code

(DONE)not saving or updating when there is an open multi-line comment

(DONE)does questions need a delete button? NO

(DONE)how should we handle partial credit?
   (DONE)make score for started questions 0

(DONE)Default question name to 'Q' + question_number

(DONE)students_answers_to_questions will always update on run with current values, even when completion_status=completed
   (DONE)this could lead to a student getting an answer right and changing it and losing points, thats ok though

(DONE)need to find a good way to show the start_code after the instructions in controller question action read_for_student

(DONE)Make start_code area in controller=question action=read_for_student collapsible
