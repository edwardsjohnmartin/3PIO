(LOW)
	there is an issue right now where if a concept contains a lesson that doesn't have any exercises
	and it is the only lesson in that concept, the student will have automatic 100% completion and the 
	concept header in section read_student view will be green

	(FIX)
		only allow a concept to be viewed as complete(green) if all previous concepts are complete(green)

(LOW)
	prevent site caching so when a change is uploaded to the server, the cache doesn't need to 
	be cleared for the user to access the changes
	http://securityevaluators.com/knowledge/case_studies/caching/
	http://www.i18nguy.com/markup/metatags.html

Include an index to the lessons. Each lesson could be a link to 

(HIGH)

(LOW) 
	In review_exam, add a button to get back to the section_grades view
	Currently you have to re-navigate through selected Manage->Grades->Select Section 

(MED) 
	In the dynamic view, make the left title and subtitle stationary
	That way no matter which button the area is scrolled to, the info can still be seen	

(HIGH)
	If code hasn't been saved, when a user tried to exit the window, let them know they need to save their code.
	Have a prompt come up asking if they want to leave or not.

(LOW)Have a button to save the code in the editor in sandbox mode
	Save one set of code per user to the database
	Be able to retrieve the code as well from a button or option in the dropdown
	possibly save the code when the run button is pressed

(MED)
    (BUG)
        make the review_exam link active only when a student has at least 1 answer on the exam
        
(MED)
    (FEATURE)
         On section grades view per exam, include average, high, low
         Be able to sort columns
        
         In the future include avg time on each question, most missed question, etc...
         
(LOW)
    (FEATURE)
         (DATABASE) On exam review page per student, include % of time on each question
         (DATABASE) time_taken starts at 0, timer starts when they to get to question, when they leave the difference is added to time_taken 
         (VIEW) How long did the student take on the exam (latest date_updated - earliest date_updated)  
	 Save a time when they first opened the exam

(MED)
    (FEATURE/BUG)
        Add a close option that allows you to close the students who get done with the test early
        Currently, if a student leaves the exam early, if the close_time isnt updated for that student they would still be able to access it and could look up answers

(LOW)
    (BUG)
        dont run logout script in sandbox, only exercise, project, and question

(HIGH)
    if a student hasnt done a set of exercises
    the button to get to the project of any concept that comes after will be disabled
    this makes it SEEM like the student cannot access the project and will need to do the previous exercises

    the route to project will still be open to the student though and if they enter the correct concept_id into the address bar
    they will be able to access the project with no issue
    it will still allow them to save the project

    there is also a bug with partners where if there are 2 students
    student A has completed all the exercises and has access to the current project
    student B has not completed all the exercises and does not have access to the current project
    if stud A logs in and adds stud B as a partner
    the code will still be saved for stud B with no issue

    (FIX)
        (FUNCTION)make a project/exercise/concept/lesson controller function that checks for unfinished exercises
            make sure to check if exercises/lessons exist in that concept and account for it
            should only be based on exercise completion, not project completion 
        when there is 1 person logged in
            put a check on the project controller that finds out if they have access to that project
                if they havent completed the exercises
            display message ('you need to complete exercises from [earliest unfinished concept name] in order to access this project')
        when there is more than 1 person logged in
            put a check on the project controller that finds out if all logged in users have access to the project
            if any user hasnt completed the exercises
                display message ('[user name] needs to complete more exercises for this group to access the project')

(HIGH)
    (BUG)
        as a ta
        when there are no lessons with no exercises in a concept, but that concept still
        has a project, there is no way to access the view code for the project
        this means a ta will have no way of grading the project 
    (FIX)
        create a table header row
            student column exists when there are students in the section the concept belongs to
            a column exists for each lesson in the concept as long as there are exercises in the lesson
            project column exists as long as a project exists for that concept

(LOW)
    (BUG)
        a ta/teacher can access the check project view for a student even if they havent 
        submitted any code for that project by changing the id value in the address bar

	when they access it, the start code for the project isnt displayed although with the 
        proposed fix, this will be a non-issue
        
        this is inconsistent because the 'view code' link will not be available to the ta/teacher
        on the controller=concept&action=read view

    (FIX)
        if a ta/teacher tries to access the project for a student with no progress on that project
        display message('[student name] has not started this project')

(HIGH)
    (VIEW)on pages with left navbar for tiles, code area, output area   (exercise editor for sure)
    (VIEW)making the <div class="textOutput"> height to 100% and <pre id="output"> height to 100% makes it scroll

(HIGH)figure out how an exam knows what section to be created for when doing regular create
   (CHECK)figure out how an exam knows what section to be created for with the importer
   (FIX)make sure you can set the exam section through the importer

[which solution to implement?]
(LOW)questions heading shown but doesn't display questions
   (SOLUTION)make questions not visible on either
   (SOLUTION)make questions only visible on /shared/read.php
   (VIEW)happens in /exam/update_times.php and /shared/read.php

(MED)exam instructions aren't being filled when created through importer
   (REGEX)fix get_exams function in /importer.php

(MED)need to show exam instructions to the students in some way
   (VIEW)can only see instructions in /exam/update_times.php and /shared/read.php
   (NEW PAGE)Adding a landing page to the exam could solve this

(VERY LOW)sproc_read_section_get(id integer) can return concepts that are deleted
    (CONTROLLER)as a ta, on controller=section action=read id=[section_id] 
    (CONTROLLER)deleted concepts show up
    (VIEW)creates links to controller=concept action=read id=[concept_id] that lead to error page

[which solution to implement?]
(LOW)make exam delete button work
   (DATABASE)sproc_write_exam_delete(exam_id)
   (DATABASE)exam_id is saved in question so we should delete the questions associated with that exam too
   (DATABASE)or we can take out the exam_id column from questions and make a question_to_exam table and remove the links of those questions to the deleted exam

(LOW)annotate point value on left navbar squares
   (VIEW)(MODEL)

[which solution to implement?]
(MED)add a way to track when the window regained focus while a student is taking an exam
   (DATABASE)rename user_left_page_occurrences to just occurrences
   (DATABASE)change date_of_occurrence column to time_left
   (DATABASE)add column time_returned
   (VIEW)will also need a better way to view these
   (VIEW)do we want to see all the occurred in the sections the logged-in user has access to 
   (VIEW)do we want to view by sections, students, exams, or questions

(MED)ta's need to be able to view occurrences

(LOW)move occurrence files to make more logical sense
   (VIEW)add /occurences/ folder and put views in there
   (VIEW)move /questions/read_occurrences.php to occurrences/ folder and rename to read
   (CONTROLLER)move read_occurrences function in /question_controller.php to /exam_controller.php

(LOW)add a button to view/question/editor that replaces the current code with the start code

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(DONE)we want to make both grade views the same as it is on the exam
   (DONE)/grades/section_grades.php
   (DONE)/grades/exam_grades_for_student.php)

(DONE)In dynamic view, make the row with the scroll bar, dropdown menu, and <pre> area collapsible

(DONE)should we block entry to controller=question action=read_for_student if a partner is logged in?
   Having a partner logged in doesn't change anything becuase it doesn't save anything for then

(DONE)need a way to review exams

(DONE)
    (BUG/JS)when a student is doing a project, when they hit the run button, the code
        code window scrolls to the top
    (BUG)the issue is the line editor.setValue(editor.getValue().replace(/\t/g, '    '));

(DONE)ALWAYS POPULATE ERROR MESSAGE

(DONE)How do I handle bringing up a question where there is starter code?
    (DONE)YES - If an answer exists don't show starter code?
    (DONE)NO - Have a reset button that puts the starter code back?
    (DONE)YES - Show the starter code in the instructions?
    (DONE)NO - Show the starter code in a different area?

(DONE)Should we allow or deny copy and paste? STAY DISABLED

(DONE)move completion_status_id to students_answers_to_questions

(DONE)move date_updated to students_answers_to_questions

(DONE)checks for question controller read_for_student view
   (DONE)make sure is within start_time and close_time
   (DONE)make sure question id is in exam
   (DONE)make sure exam is available to student

(DONE)fix order of alerts when creating exam/question

(DONE)need a way for a student to see their grades for exams on the website

(DONE)make exam update button work

(DONE)make question update button work

(DONE)change the permission type of controller=grades action=get_section_grades so TA can see grades   
   (DONE)will need to do error handling to make sure only a TA student will be able to access this

(DONE)on controller=question action=read_for_student or run button being pressed
   (DONE)check to make sure current_time is still within start_time and close_time

(DONE)not updating tiles when there is a bug in the code
   (DONE)is updating tiles when finished successfully
   (DONE)is updating when no bugs but not correct tested again test_code

(DONE)not saving or updating when there is an open multi-line comment

(DONE)does questions need a delete button? NO

(DONE)how should we handle partial credit?
   (DONE)make score for started questions 0

(DONE)Default question name to 'Q' + question_number

(DONE)students_answers_to_questions will always update on run with current values, even when completion_status=completed
   (DONE)this could lead to a student getting an answer right and changing it and losing points, thats ok though

(DONE)need to find a good way to show the start_code after the instructions in controller question action read_for_student

(DONE)Make start_code area in controller=question action=read_for_student collapsible

(DONE)Make description in controller=project action=check collapsible

(DONE)on controller=grades action=get_section_grades
   (DONE)put percentage in seperate column

(DONE)(NO)do we want to be able to update grades in controller=grades action=get_section_grades?
   (DONE)brings the issue of needing to change the completion_status for a student_to_question to change the score in the db
   (DONE)this ruins the integrity of the score

(DONE)user needs to be notified somehow that a new tab or window was opened and browsed to
   (DONE)not gonna do this, changing the navbar color is the solution

(DONE)make the left navbar area of controller=question action=read_for_student yellow so can be easily seen
   (DONE)teacher and ta in the room will know they are on the wrong page if they dont see the yellow

(DONE)Add a database table to record if a student went off the page
   (DONE)student_id, question_id, exam_id, date_of_occurrence

(DONE)while taking an exam, make the next button that pops up to next question instead of next exercise

(DONE)after uploading an exam through a file, make the exam link go to exam_controller action=update_times instead of action=read

(DONE)exam names not coming up in occurrences view

(DONE)change the permission type of controller=exam action=update_times to read so TA can update times
    (DONE)will need to do error handling to make sure only a TA student will be able to access this
    (DONE)need to add a path to controller=exam action=update_times for the TA
