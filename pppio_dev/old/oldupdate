<p>the name property on the model...?</p>

		<?php echo $key ?>
		<?php echo $value
		//need some kind of tags around these
		//use input. name is key. i probably need to be careful about not allowing html/js. where to check...
		//need to deal with what type of input... text, number, etc...
		//gettype? type hinting?
		//type hinting is not available in this case. it's for functions.
		//i should create some type of helper 
		//types i need
		//integer - number
		//string - text
		//datetime - datetime? text? should have class for styling
		//boolean - checkbox

		//but checking the type of the value won't work for the first (if it's empty)...
		//can use settype! in constructor for models? hmm....

		//id from db in test site was integer as it should have been

<?php }
//if the user has privileges, we should also show the create/edit/delete... i still need to know the model name here to create the links, even if models are fetched in the controller. ah but... if i set it in the controller, i know it... of course...

//maybe this should be a class and have a function for output. that way it can be told the model... that was in an example
